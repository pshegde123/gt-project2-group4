    closets near the window that is near the attic. One of the police\
    department canines visibly refuses to enter a downstairs conference\

    some current and some retired employees can tell of the oddities that\
    have sometimes occurred in the house. 'Little John' was\
    supposedly a son of one of the Braseltons that had some slight mental\
    problems. Little John allegedly occupied the house for a while and used\
    to pick up stray dogs as pet. He and the dogs mostly resided in\
    the attic until his death. Although rarely talked about, there is also\
    a report of one of the former Braselton matrons being seen in the\
    downstairs bathroom. Prior to the house becoming the Town Hall, it was\
    sometimes used for wedding receptions and other events. Supposedly, a\
    guest at one of the weddings proclaimed to be a psychic and he told of\
    seeing people dressed in formal attire from the twenties standing in\
    the hall and of seeing the Braselton female in and around the bathroom.\
    Being that no harm ever seems to be done, some of the employees just\
    laugh when things occur and write it off as Little John being in the\

    lore: "An old abandoned mental\
    hospital. It is believed to be haunted by souls that were tortured in\
    the basement of the hospital. There is the stench of blood as you walk\
    in and you can see spirits roaming the grounds. There is also a tunnel\
    in the basement, but no one has ever been to the end of it. If you go\
    to this hospital you will have to park your car in the front of the\
    hospital and walk around it to the back where there is an opening in\
    the fence. It is located off of Turner Rd. Near Kramardie beach. -\

    right on top of the old family's pet cemetery. In the late 1800s, the\
    farmer put his rabid blue tick hound out of his misery by blowing his\
    brains out with a shotgun. He then proceeded to drag his body in\
    circles around the outskirts of the campus green. They say that on the\
    anniversary of the dog's death, you can see him chasing cats around\
    campus with his head still split from the shotgun.",

    lore: "As the story goes\
    the townspeople burned the church/school with teacher and students\
    inside after learning that the teacher was relaying satanic\
    information. The children's graves are have unmarked wooden markers,\
    perhaps because the bodies were unidentifiable, or perhaps because the\
    townsfolk did not want to remember what was done there that day, the\
    teacher is buried next to the children and her grave is unnamed and is\
    marked by a four foot high pile of bricks. Loud, clear, but\
    unintelligible voices can be heard, apparitions, or as called locally,\
    walkers can be seen, sometimes taking a human-like form, sometimes in\
    the form of animal-like creatures, lost time can also be experienced.\
    Bricks taken from the grave have, in my experience cause spontaneous\
    fires of objects they are near/on.",
